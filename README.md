# org-knowledgebase
An engineering knowledgebase providing organisation technical documentation useful for both engineers and non-technical staff.

This knowledgebase is built upon the widely utilised distributed version-control system Git and is hosted on GitHub. Two versions are available:

1. Code view (markdown) available [here](https://github.com/danpilch/org-knowledgebase/blob/master/README.md)
2. GitHub Pages view available [here](https://danpilch.github.io/org-knowledgebase/) 

These two views allow for flexibility in the organisation and make technical documentation accessible to both engineers and more business focused team members.

## Example knowledgebase uses

A non-exhaustive list of possible uses for a version controlled knowledgebase: 

- Onboarding documentation (for welcoming new employees into the organisation and current employees switching teams. This should be a living document updated regularly by each team)
- Remote working standards (how the organisation works remotely, what is expected of an employee, tips, guidance and best practices)
- Architecture (defines how different components work together in a workload. Often with a focus on diagrams) 
- Runbooks (to enable consistent and quick responses to understood events in a system. For example, these could help an on-call team member triage a system they aren't actively involed in maintaining) 
- Offboarding documentation (when an employee leaves the organisation, what steps are required to safely alight from the business)
